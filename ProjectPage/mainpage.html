				<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The past three decades of immigration patterns in the United States have been largely characterized
					by human migratory flows from Latin America, commonly described in terms of an ongoing ‘migration
					crisis’ (Wilson, 2019). These migratory patterns have surged in response to ongoing regional turmoil
					on social, political, ecological and economic fronts (Meyer & Taft-Morales, 2019). Drivers of the
					migration crisis include trade policies which have favored economic liberalization at the expense of
					social welfare, ecological catastrophe, or the flee from persecution and violence. Despite this,
					western media perspectives of this ongoing ‘crisis’ are more concerned with semantics (Nikitina,
					2016). In this interactive narrative, we hope to address these discrepancies. As such, we will
					illustrate contemporary and historic patterns of migration from Latin America to the United States
					by discussing geopolitical, economic, and ecological crises underpinning these shifts (i.e., push
					factors). Next, we will discuss economic and political factors which serve to justify the movement
					of individuals to the United States (i.e., pull factors). We will then illustrate how these issues
					culminate in a phenomenon known as the migrant caravan. Our goal is to demystify the so-called
					‘migration crisis’ and offer insights on the often-overlooked drivers of these human migratory
					patterns.

				<h3>Trade policy</h3>

				<p>Since the 1980s, several key economic policies have made the conditions for the contemporary Latin
					American migration crisis possible. These economic strategies have typically been characterized by
					neoliberal traits such as deregulation, privatization, and free-trade, and have been paralleled by
					growing rates of Latin American emigration (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). Two particularly influential
					policies were the Washington Consensus and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). A
					preliminary understanding of the conditions that led two these two agreements and their subsequent
					mass migratory movements is critical.
				</p>
				<p>Throughout the 1970s, commercial banks and creditors in the United States were distributing loans
					amongst Latin American countries, primarily for the purpose of infrastructure development
					(Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). The burden of servicing these foreign debts reached a breaking point in
					1982 when Mexico announced that they would no longer be able to service their debt to US creditors
					(Sims & Romero, 2013). Sixteen more Latin American countries soon followed, leading to mass
					restructurings of outstanding loans (Sims & Romero, 2013).
				</p>
				<p>One of the most significant attempts to alleviate the burden of these loans was the Washington
					Consensus of 1990 (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). The Washington Consensus was drafted by foreign players
					such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, and its framework revolved around
					categorically neoliberal attributes, namely the liberalization of trade, deregulation of labour
					markets, and privatization of public institutions (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). The goal of the
					policies was to make the debtor nations competitive in the international market and alleviate their
					crushing debt (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). These policies soon became accompanied by an increase in
					Latin American immigration to the United States.
				</p>
				<p>Latin American migration to the United States rose considerably following the Washington Consensus
					(Figure 1). While labour and capital productivity improved, one of the most significant outcomes of
					the consensus was mass unemployment (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). This is because the Washington
					Consensus increased labor-intensive work in non-competitive industries such as agriculture while
					simultaneously instigating mass layoffs from formerly public institutions (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010).
					Consequently, workers were displaced from formal jobs in government and business sectors to
					precarious positions which offered little stability, leading to a discernible increase in migrations
					during the 1990s (Zamora, 2014). As Khoudour-Castéras contends, Latin American emigration
					“represents a safety valve that reduces pressure on [domestic] labor markets” (2010, p. 440).
				</p>
				<p>In an attempt to contain these emerging patterns of migration, Canada, the United States, and
					Mexico’s government introduced NAFTA in 1994 (Hing, 2010). NAFTA was designed to improve Mexico’s
					economy, which would in turn create more jobs and reduce mass migrations that were taking place
					(Zamora, 2014). It embodied many of the same ideals that defined the Washington Consensus, notably
					trade liberalization (Zamora, 2014). Once again, however, though certain metrics such as total
					exports from Mexico had increased following the agreement, the trade-off entailed growing social
					insecurity and increasingly polarizing wealth disparities (Hing, 2010). While Mexico affirmed its
					position as an export-oriented economy as a result of NAFTA, the number of labour migrants leaving
					the country to secure capital abroad continued to increase (Hing, 2010).
				</p>


				<h3>Ecological disaster</h3>
				<p>Many Central American countries are experiencing the forced emigration of individuals whose
					livelihoods have been undermined by climate change induced natural disasters. Between 1998 and 2017,
					Puerto Rico, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Dominica were among the top ten countries most affected
					by extreme weather events driven by climate change (Eckstein et al., 2018). Many Central American
					countries are at a high risk of environmental destruction from tropical cyclones and secondary
					hazards like flooding and coastal inundation. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch destroyed 70% of Honduras’
					crops and infrastructure, as well as cost the Nicaraguan economy approximately $1 billion USD in
					damages. Between 1990 and 2000, emigration from Honduras to the US more than doubled from 108,900 to
					282,852 individuals (Countries of Birth for U.S. Immigrants, 1960-Present, 2013).
				</p>
				<p>Most recently, Hurricanes Eta and Iota ravaged through parts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and a
					few other Central American countries in November 2020. The hurricanes brought severe flooding and
					landslides to the area, and the destructive costs have yet to be fully understood. The impacted
					countries were already hard hit by a five-year drought and the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to
					predictions of severe food insecurity in the region (Hurricane Eta Leaves Millions in Central
					America Needing Urgent Food Assistance | World Food Programme, n.d.). There are currently reports of
					large migrant caravans heading towards the US, driven by these disastrous losses (Desperation Grows
					in Battered Honduras, Fueling Migration, 2021).
				</p>
				<p>From Figure 1, we can observe differential migration trends from Central American and Carribean
					countries. Some of the countries hit hardest by environmental disasters like Honduras and Guatemala
					actually have relatively low emigration rates compared to countries like Belize and El Salvador.
					This suggests that while environmental disasters may compel some individuals to leave their
					countries, it may not be the primary driver of migration. This aligns with the concept that
					environmental disasters amplify previous migration trends, which rely on existing socio-political
					conditions (Loebach, 2019). For example, in Honduras, migration is viewed as a threat to the local
					economies and is generally discouraged (Gagnon, 2011). This serves as a potential cultural
					explanation for its low emigration despite the impacts of natural hazards. That said, migration
					rates for the aforementioned Central American countries did spike in the 1980s, when these natural
					disasters began to increase in frequency.
				</p>

				<h3>Escaping violence</h3>
				<p>The Latino population in the US exploded following the 1960s, coinciding with a period of political
					instability (Figure 1). Throughout the 20th century, political instability fueled civil wars,
					guerilla movements, and social uprisings across the region. Some of the most prolific political
					shocks in Latin America during this time include the Cuban Revolution, and the fall of the Trujillo
					and Somoza regimes in the Domincan Republic and Nicaragua, respectively. Many United States policies
					for Latin American migration were also developed during this time, including the 1986 Immigration
					Reform and Control Act and the Temporary Protected Status policy (Tienda & Sánchez, 2013). Some of
					these policies pertained to asylum seekers or natural disaster refugees. Most importantly, these
					policies opened the door for emigration driven by post-conflict violence.
				</p>
				<p>Weak transitional governments of democratic regimes gave rise to powerful drug and gang cartels, as
					well as militias and vigilante groups; inefficient police forces and judiciaries have made
					maintaining public safety and civility difficult in many of these countries (Albarracín & Barnes,
					2020; Alvarado & Massey, 2010). In Central America, drug trafficking, homicide, youth gangs,
					domestic violence, firearms trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, and corruption have been
					identified as the most serious criminal problems by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
					(2007). A 2018 survey of migrants in the Salvadoran caravan found that 18% cited violence and
					insecurity as their motive for leaving (Meyer & Taft-Morales, n.d.). Mexican migration to the United
					States has generally decreased in the past 20 years, however emigration from Mexican border cities
					has increased since 2008 due to drug-related violence and extortion (Contreras, 2014).

				<!-- PULL FACTORS-->
				<h2>Pull factors</h2>

				<br>

				<p>After establishing where migrants are coming from and why, the next natural question is, “Where are
					they going, and why?” Latin American immigrants tend to cluster in California, Texas, New York,
					Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are known as the “Big Six”, and this is reflected in the
					high density of Latin America-born individuals in those states (Figure 2). This section highlights
					three pull factors that may have contributed to this spatial distribution: economic opportunities,
					sanctuary cities, and existing immigrant networks.
				</p>
				<h3>Economic Opportunities</h3>

				<p>Jobs in the agriculture and construction industries often attract immigrants, particularly
					undocumented individuals, who may lack the communication skills to find work elsewhere. California
					and Texas have the largest agricultural industries of the Big Six, attracting immigrants to the
					region, many of whom may already have experience working in an agricultural setting (ERS Farm Income
					Team, 2021; Wilson, 2019). Similarly, low-skill and low-wage labor is available in the construction
					industry. Following a construction boom fueled by low interest rates in the 1990s, the proportion of
					foreign-born construction workers increased from 10% in 1994 to 22% in 2005 (Orrenius & Zavodny,
					2009). While agriculture and construction jobs can be dangerous and laborious, they present viable
					livelihoods for those without alternatives.
				</p>

				<h3>Sanctuary Cities</h3>
				<p>Sanctuary cities refer to municipalities that do not assist federal immigration enforcement in the
					apprehension and expulsion of undocumented immigrants. The “Sanctuary Movement” began in the 1980s
					in response to federal efforts to expel undocumented Central Americans who were fleeing violence in
					their home countries. Since then, more than two hundred cities in 29 states have passed resolutions
					designating themselves as sanctuaries (Griffith & Vaughan, 2021). Of the Big Six, California,
					Illinois, New York, and New Jersey have designated themselves as Sanctuary States. These states also
					have a higher observed density of Latin American immigrants (Figure 2).
				</p>
				<p>Sanctuary is provided to undocumented immigrants in different forms, depending on the location.
					Primarily, sanctuary policies have some formal non-cooperation law or ordinance that prevents local
					officers from engaging in immigration law enforcement activities, such as honoring ICE detainment
					notices (Collingwood & Gonzalez-O’Brien, 2019). Some hybrid sanctuaries operate under “don’t ask,
					don’t tell” ordinances, in which local officers are forbidden from asking any individual about their
					immigration status. Aside from compassionate reasons, these policies serve the purpose of allowing
					undocumented immigrants to report crimes without fear of deportation thereby giving them access to
					public safety services.
				</p>

				<h3>Immigrant Networks</h3>
				<p>Latin American migrants tend to move to areas that already have a substantial community of migrants
					with similar backgrounds, known as ethnic enclaves (Chiswick & Miller, 2004). Generally, Latin
					American immigration patterns tend to follow the spatial-assimilation model, which posits that new
					immigrants will initially reside in ethnic enclaves then move to better areas once they have
					assimilated and achieved financial stability (Paiva-Turra, 2003). In these enclaves, migrants get
					access to support networks of individuals who have experience navigating their new homes,
					particularly in aspects like obtaining official documents and finding job opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>On the other hand, transnational network connections have also been found to be a primary determinant
					of where an immigrant ends up (Pena, 2009). This usually entails obtaining green cards through
					family reunification and sponsorship processes, which is the channel through which the majority of
					South Americans go through to reach the United States (Batalova, 2018). In both scenarios, immigrant
					communities tend to grow larger over time as new immigrants follow the footsteps of their
					predecessors. This, along with other pull factors, contribute to the disproportionate clusters of
					migrant communities in a select few gateway states.</p>

				<!-- MIGRANT CARAVAN-->
				<h2>Migrant caravans</h2>

				<figure style="font-size: smaller;">
					<iframe src="https://ubc-geob472-spring2021.github.io/final-project-adejs/Map1/map1story.html"
						frameborder="0" width="100%" height="700"> </iframe>
					<figcaption><b>Figure 3: </b>Map of Late 2018 Migrant Caravan (2018). Various sources. See map
						details for embedded sources.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br>
				<p>The migrant caravan is a complex social phenomenon which has emerged in response to the interplay
					between the aforementioned push and pull factors. They consist of large groups of individuals
					fleeing war, economic instability, and violence, making their way north to the US border in hopes of
					safety (Isaacs, 2019). Due to the risks involved during these travels, caravans are formed with the
					goal of “safety in numbers” (Isaacs, 2019, p. 55). The caravan reviewed in the map above originated
					in Honduras in October of 2018 and travelled 4000 kilometres north where 5000 migrants arrived at
					the US-Mexico border in November of 2018 (“Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter?”,
					2018). As observed in the map above, migrant caravans fluctuate in size as people join and leave
					along their long and arduous journey.
				</p>
				<p>The migrant caravan has been a heavily politicized issue. The time in which the above caravan was
					taking place, Donald Trump was in the throes of a re-election campaign, where he was conveying
					strong anti-immigration and isolationist rhetorical points, referring to such caravans as
					“invasions” (Webber, 2018). Evidently, the disconnect between the sensationalized rhetoric that was
					circulating about the migrant caravan versus the social and political push factors that were some
					notable drivers of it, was strong. </p>

				<!-- CONCLUSION -->
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>As a whole, it is difficult to untangle the complex push and pull factors for migration from Latin
					American countries to the United States. Our data suggests that migration spiked considerably in the
					1980s, likely due to regional political and economic instability. While rates have declined slightly
					since then, migration from the Americas continue to dominate US immigration relative to other
					regions (U.S. Immigration Trends, 2013). We posit from our literature review that this migration was
					fueled by instability caused by frequent environmental hazards and social disorder. This section
					highlighted certain countries that experienced these proposed push factors, but Latin America is a
					diverse region with different economic, political, social, environmental conditions, and people with
					their own goals. Consequently, our narrative can only go over these migration factors in broad
					strokes.
				</p>
				<p>Our proposed pull factors may contribute to the decisions of some migrants to move to a certain state
					but they are not definitive for all migrants. We suggest immigrants tend to concentrate in enclaves
					where they are able to access expansive social and economic networks laid out by their predecessors.
					States with immigrant-friendly policies and industries are often preferred; from sanctuary cities
					offering public safety services to agribusinesses offering liveable wages, factors were distributed
					differently across states but their cumulative effects on migration were greatest in the Big Six. At
					the same time, our proposed factors are but three of many possible reasons for migrating to a
					specific state. Overall, lost in the data and sweeping generalizations about push and pull factors
					are the individual stories and motivations that drive somebody’s desire to uproot their lives to a
					foreign place. In a sense, it is conceivable that the migrant caravans embody the migration crisis
					at large – the people who partake in these journeys are acutely aware of the risks they face in
					order to get to their hopeful destination, risks such as accidents, assaults, kidnapping, murder,
					deportations, and extortion, yet they choose to venture regardless (Isaacs, 2019).
