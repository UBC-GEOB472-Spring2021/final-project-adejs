									<h1>Migration between<br />
									the US and Latin America</h1>
									<p>By Jason Adle, Alison Deere, Sara Jafroudi, Elana Shi</p>

								</header>
								
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>The past three decades of immigration patterns in the United States has been largely characterized by human migratory flows from Latin and Central America. This particular subset of migrants has been commonly described in terms of an ongoing “Latin American migration crisis” which refers to massive movements of individuals who are making concerted efforts to flee their hometowns for a multitude of social, economic, and ecological reasons. However, western media perspectives of this ongoing ‘crisis’ are often hollow and more concerned with semantics. 

								</p>
								
								<p>Drivers of the migration crisis, including historic and contemporary trade policies which have favored economic liberalization at the expense of social welfare, ecological catastrophe, or the flee from persecution and violence, are seldom noted in popular political discourse. In this interactive narrative, we hope to address these discrepancies. As such, we will illustrate contemporary and historic patterns of migration from Latin America to the United States by discussing geopolitical and economic tensions underpinning these shifts (i.e., push factors). In order to understand modern immigration patterns in the United States, we will discuss socio-economic and political factors which serve to justify the movement of individuals to the United States (i.e., pull factors). We will then illustrate how these issues culminate in a phenomenon known as the migrant caravan. Our goal is to demystify the so-called ‘migration crisis’ and offer insights on the often-overlooked drivers of these human migratory patterns.

								<h3>Trade policy</h3>
								
								<p>Since the 1980s, several key economic policies have made the conditions for the contemporary Latin American migration crisis possible. These policies, which have been paralleled by growing rates of Latin American emigration, have typically been characterized by neoliberal attributes such as deregulation, privatization, and free-trade (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). Placing the so-called migration crisis in the context of these socially and economically consequential policies is integral to understanding the current state affairs. Two particularly influential policies were the Washington Consensus and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). However, it is important to first elaborate on the particular conditions which paved the way for these policies.
								</p>
								
								<p>Servicing foreign debt proved to be a critical issue in Latin America which would culminate as a debt crisis in the 1980s (Sims & Romero, 2013). Throughout the 1970s, commercial banks and creditors within the United States were distributing loans amongst Latin American countries for the purposes of infrastructure development and military spending (Khoudour-Castéras, 2010). By 1982, Mexico, which at that point in time had a total debt accruing to $80 billion, announced that they would no longer be able to service their debt to US creditors (Sims & Romero, 2013). Sixteen more Latin American countries soon followed, leading to mass restructurings of outstanding loans (Sims & Romero, 2013).
								</p>
								
								<h3>Ecological disaster</h3>
								<p>Many Central American countries are experiencing the forced emigration of individuals whose livelihoods have been undermined by climate change induced natural disasters. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Dominica were among the top ten countries most affected by extreme weather events driven by climate change (Eckstein et al., 2018). Many Central American countries are at a high risk of environmental destruction from tropical cyclones and secondary hazards like flooding and coastal inundation. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch destroyed 70% of Honduras’ crops and infrastructure, as well as cost the Nicaraguan economy approximately $1 billion USD in direct and indirect damages.. Between 1990 and 2000, emigration from Honduras to the US more than doubled from 108,900 to 282,852 individuals (Countries of Birth for U.S. Immigrants, 1960-Present, 2013).
								</p>
								
								<p>Most recently, Hurricanes Eta and Iota ravaged through parts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and a few other Central American countries in November 2020. The hurricanes brought severe flooding and landslides to the area, and the destructive costs have yet to be fully understood. The impacted countries were already hard hit by a five-year drought and the COVID-19 pandemic, leading the World Food Programme to predict severe food insecurity in the region (Hurricane Eta Leaves Millions in Central America Needing Urgent Food Assistance | World Food Programme, n.d.).  There are currently reports of large migrant caravans heading towards the US, driven by the loss of their homes and livelihoods(Desperation Grows in Battered Honduras, Fueling Migration, 2021).
								</p>
								
								<p>Based on the mapped historical migration data from the International Migration Institute, migration from Central American and Carribean countries is uneven. Some of the countries hit hardest by environmental disasters like Honduras and Guatemala actually have relatively low emigration rates compared to countries like Belize and El Salvador. This suggests while environmental disasters may compel some individuals to leave their countries, it has likely not been the primary driver of historic migration. This aligns with the concept that environmental disasters amplify previous migration traditions, which rely on existing social and political conditions (Loebach, 2019)(). For example, in Honduras migration is viewed as a threat to the local economy and generally discouraged, providing a potential cultural explanation for its low emigration despite the impacts of natural hazards (Gagnon, 2011).

								<h2>Migrant caravans</h2>

								<figcaption><b>Figure 3: </b>Map of Late 2018 Migrant Caravan (2018). Various sources. See map details for embedded sources.</figcaption>	
								</figure>
								<br>
								<p>Migrant caravans are events where large groups of people travel in numbers with the goal of migrating and settling in a country other than their own. Caravans are formed with the goal of “safety in numbers” during transit, as migrants do face several risks to their health and safety during their travels. These caravans can also be seen as a response to the obstructionist policies set forth by the US and Mexico during the past decade (Wurtz, 2020). The caravan reviewed in this project (between October and November 2018) came about in an interesting global context. At the time, Donald Trump was in the throes of a re-election campaign, during which he was practicing strong anti-immigration and isolationist rhetorical points, and had focused both this campaign and the previous one in 2016 in an anti-immigration, isolationist lens. The migrants in this caravan were “fleeing persecution, poverty, and violence in their home countries [of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador]” with the hope of “building a better future for themselves and their families” (“Migrant Caravan,” 2018). In other words, it is a clear manifestation of the push and pull factors mentioned earlier in this paper at work on a visibly large scale.
								</p>
								
								<p>These caravans serve as an example of mobility in a group that has had its mobility limited by an array of complex geopolitical and socio-economic barriers. In other words, it is a presentation of mobility in a time of im-mobility, both physically and socio-economically. This is reflected in the desires of the migrants in the late 2018 migrants to cross borders seeking opportunity where they find it, but also in later migration events (not necessarily including mass migration events). In early 2021, it was reported that migration flow was increasing to the US from Central America, in spite of restrictions enacted due to the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Guatemala Issues Emergency Decree as New Migrant Caravan Reported, 2021). Indeed, damage to communities and livelihoods fueled by a strong hurricane season in late 2020 and the effects of COVID-19 on communities led many to proceed in a caravan with the goal of seeking asylum in the US, this time under a different administration and different situation.
